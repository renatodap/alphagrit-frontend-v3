# Winter Arc Community - Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide covers setting up the Winter Arc PWA with full community features by November 17th.

**What's Been Built:**
- ‚úÖ PWA manifest and meta tags (install as app on iOS/Android)
- ‚úÖ Supabase community database schema (posts, comments, likes)
- ‚úÖ Community feed with real-time updates

**What's Left:**
1. Run `flutter pub get` to install new dependencies
2. Apply database migration to Supabase
3. Update router to add new screens
4. Update Stripe webhook to grant community access
5. Deploy to Vercel

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

```bash
cd frontend
flutter pub get
```

New package added:
- `timeago: ^3.7.0` - For "2 hours ago" timestamps

### Step 2: Apply Supabase Database Migration (5 minutes)

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com) ‚Üí Your Project
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire contents of `backend/db/schema/0002_community.sql`
4. Paste into SQL editor and click **Run**
5. Verify tables were created:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM programs WHERE slug = 'winter-arc';
   ```

6. **IMPORTANT**: Enable real-time replication:
   - Go to **Database > Replication**
   - Enable these tables:
     - `posts`
     - `community_comments`
     - `community_likes`

   Or run this SQL:
   ```sql
   alter publication supabase_realtime add table posts;
   alter publication supabase_realtime add table community_comments;
   alter publication supabase_realtime add table community_likes;
   ```

### Step 3: Update Router (10 minutes)

Find your `router.dart` or `app_router.dart` file and add these routes:

```dart
import 'package:alphagrit/features/community/community_feed_screen.dart';
import 'package:alphagrit/features/community/create_post_screen.dart';
import 'package:alphagrit/features/community/post_detail_screen.dart';

// Add these routes to your GoRouter configuration:

GoRoute(
  path: '/community/feed',
  builder: (context, state) {
    final programId = int.parse(state.uri.queryParameters['programId'] ?? '1');
    final programTitle = state.uri.queryParameters['programTitle'] ?? 'Winter Arc';
    return CommunityFeedScreen(
      programId: programId,
      programTitle: programTitle,
    );
  },
),

GoRoute(
  path: '/community/create-post',
  builder: (context, state) {
    final programId = int.parse(state.uri.queryParameters['programId'] ?? '1');
    return CreatePostScreen(programId: programId);
  },
),

GoRoute(
  path: '/community/post/:postId',
  builder: (context, state) {
    final postId = int.parse(state.pathParameters['postId']!);
    return PostDetailScreen(postId: postId);
  },
),
```

### Step 4: Add PWA Install Prompt to Home Screen (5 minutes)

Update your home screen or landing page to show the install prompt:

```dart
import 'package:alphagrit/features/home/pwa_install_prompt.dart';

// In your home screen widget:
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    body: Column(
      children: [
        // Your existing home screen content

        // Add this at the bottom:
        const PWAInstallPrompt(),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```

### Step 5: Update Winter Arc Landing to Link to Community (5 minutes)

Update `lib/features/winter_arc/winter_arc_landing.dart`:

After the checkout success, add a button to access community:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Get Winter Arc program ID (you'll need to fetch this)
    context.push('/community/feed?programId=1&programTitle=Winter Arc');
  },
  child: const Text('JOIN COMMUNITY'),
),
```

### Step 6: Update Stripe Webhook for Community Access (Backend)

**Location:** `backend/app/api/webhooks/stripe_webhook.py` (or similar)

When a Winter Arc purchase succeeds, grant access to the program:

```python
# After successful payment for Winter Arc
if product_id == 'winter_arc' or ebook_slug == 'winter-arc':
    # Get Winter Arc program ID
    program = supabase.table('programs').select('id').eq('slug', 'winter-arc').single().execute()
    program_id = program.data['id']

    # Grant user access to Winter Arc program
    supabase.table('user_programs').insert({
        'user_id': user_id,
        'program_id': program_id
    }).execute()
```

### Step 7: Test Locally (10 minutes)

```bash
cd frontend
flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer canvaskit
```

- [ ] Can view post details
- [ ] Can add comments
- [ ] Can like posts
- [ ] PWA install prompt shows on web
- [ ] Real-time updates work (open in two tabs, post in one, see in other)

### Step 8: Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)

```bash
cd frontend
git add .
git commit -m "Add Winter Arc community PWA features

- Community feed with real-time posts
- Create post with image upload
- Comments system
- Like/unlike posts

**If cache issues:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Redeploy"
3. Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "RLS policy prevents access to posts"
**Fix:** Ensure user has entry in `user_programs` table:
```sql
INSERT INTO user_programs (user_id, program_id)
VALUES ('YOUR_USER_ID', (SELECT id FROM programs WHERE slug = 'winter-arc'));
```

### "Failed to upload image"
**Fix:** Check storage bucket exists and policies are active:
1. Go to Supabase Storage
2. Verify `community` bucket exists
3. Check policies allow inserts for authenticated users

### "Real-time updates not working"
**Fix:** Enable replication:
```sql
alter publication supabase_realtime add table posts;
alter publication supabase_realtime add table community_comments;
alter publication supabase_realtime add table community_likes;
```

### "PWA not installing on iOS"
**Fix:** Ensure:
1. Site is served over HTTPS (Vercel handles this)
2. `manifest.json` is linked in `index.html`
3. Apple touch icons are present
4. User is using Safari (not Chrome on iOS)
